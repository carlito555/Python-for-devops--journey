FizzBuzz with a DevOps Twist
A classic, but reframed. Given a list of port numbers, print a status for each:

If the port is divisible by 3, print "Maintenance"
If the port is divisible by 5, print "Throttled"
If divisible by both, print "Offline"
Otherwise, print "Active: <port>"

ports = [80, 443, 3306, 8080, 9090, 15, 22, 3000, 5000, 30]
