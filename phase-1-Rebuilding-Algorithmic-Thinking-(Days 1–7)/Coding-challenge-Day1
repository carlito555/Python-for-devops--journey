### Your script must:

**Part 1 — Basic Filtering**
Print the names of all servers that are `"running"` and in `"production"`.

**Part 2 — Alert Logic**
Print a `"HIGH CPU ALERT"` warning for any running server with `cpu > 80`. Include the server name and CPU value in the message.

**Part 3 — Summary Report**
Print a summary that shows:
- Total number of servers
- How many are running vs stopped
- Average CPU across all running servers (rounded to 1 decimal place)
- Count of servers per environment

**Part 4 — Bonus Challenge**
Write a function called `get_critical_servers` that takes the server list and a CPU threshold as arguments, and returns a sorted list of server names (alphabetically) where the server is running and CPU exceeds the threshold.

## 📋 What Good Looks Like

Your output should look something like this when you run your script:
```
--- Production Running Servers ---
web-01, web-02, db-01, web-03

--- CPU Alerts ---
HIGH CPU ALERT: web-01 is at 85% CPU
HIGH CPU ALERT: db-01 is at 95% CPU
HIGH CPU ALERT: db-02 is at 88% CPU

--- Summary Report ---
Total servers: 8
Running: 6 | Stopped: 2
Average CPU (running): 73.3%
production: 5 servers
staging: 3 servers

--- Critical Servers (threshold: 80%) ---
['db-01', 'db-02', 'web-01']
