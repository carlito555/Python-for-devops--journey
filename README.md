## 📌 About This Repository
This repository documents my 30-day journey to master Python for infrastructure automation, backend development, and multicloud API interactions. 

As a DevOps Engineer and an **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2025 Certified Multicloud Architecture Professional**, my goal with this challenge is to bridge the gap between core Python fundamentals and production-grade automation. 

**Live Portfolio:** [Visit my website](https://[Your Custom Domain]) *(Hosted via AWS S3 & Route 53)*

## 📂 Repository Structure
The curriculum is broken down into four practical phases:

- `📁 phase-1-fundamentals/` - Algorithmic thinking, math/logic puzzles, and core syntax.
- `📁 phase-2-infrastructure/` - System operations, OS libraries, and JSON/YAML parsing.
- `📁 phase-3-api-automation/` - Interacting with tools like Kubernetes, Jenkins, Helm, and Terraform via APIs/Webhooks.
- `📁 phase-4-backend/` - Building fast, lightweight API endpoints (FastAPI/Flask) to serve infrastructure data.

*(Note: The tracker will be updated daily as I complete each challenge.)*

## 💡 How I'm Approaching This
1. **No copy-pasting solutions:** Every script is written by hand.
2. **Production-mindset:** Commits follow conventional commit standards (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
3. **Documentation:** Each day's folder contains a brief explanation of the problem and the solution.
